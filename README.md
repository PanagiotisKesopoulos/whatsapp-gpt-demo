Multi-Business WhatsApp GPT-4 Assistant (Demo)
This is a simple demo backend I built using FastAPI + OpenAI GPT-4 to simulate a smart assistant that could answer WhatsApp messages for small businesses (like dentists, barbershops, etc.).

👨‍🔧 Use Case: Local businesses needing automated customer support
🧠 AI Brain: GPT-4 via OpenAI API
💬 Chat Interface: Simulated WhatsApp logic (WhatsApp API not connected in this version)

I'm using this repo to show I can build and structure an MVP-style AI assistant backend.
Each business can have its own services, hours, and custom prompt loaded on the fly.

It's not connected to Twilio or WhatsApp yet — just focusing on the core logic here.
You’re welcome to fork it or build from it.
